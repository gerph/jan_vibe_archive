 This archive contains Jan Vibe's BASIC programs, a complete collection of
 graphical oddities and special effects written for RISC OS-powered computers
 in the late-1980s and 1990s. Most were published in Acorn User magazine in
 its Star Info programming section. They are redistributed here with
 permission from Jan, the original author of the work.

 Due to their age, many of the programs will only run comfortably on
 RISC OS 3, although a number of programs in the BAS13 directory were written
 after Jan bought his RiscPC, so they will work on more modern setups.
 To run RISC OS 3 on your desktop, you should check out Tom Walker's Arculator
 or Jan Boer's A310 emulator.

 According to Jan, "This archive contains ALL the Acorn BASIC programs I
 have made. There is probably a lot of crap in there, but all the programs
 published in Star Info is there too. And probably some you have not seen.
 Consider it freeware, but if you put it on your homepage, please say that
 it was me that wrote them."
